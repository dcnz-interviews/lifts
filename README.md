# Lifts
Welcome to our technical challenge.
Here at Datacom we work with all kinds of customer problems on a day to day basis. 
These can range from search algorithms on shopping applications to full-blown systems. 
Hopefully this challenge sparks some of that passion we share for solving problems and future proofing for the next colleague that comes along. 
To complete this please fork from this git repository and treat each question as a feature branch, you can merge them back into main once you've completed each of them. 
<br />
Remember to add in some unit tests to randomize the input.

## Question 1
There are two lifts in a building with a single controller at the bottom floor (Sorry people at the top floor)
This single controller checks which lift is the closest and notifies it to come down to the ground floor.
The following output needs to be displayed:

2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Button Pressed “Up”
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Lift #2 selected
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #2 moving
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #2 arrived

## Question 2
After multiple complaints from people the company decided to add in a controller on each level.
Implement the new logic, remember the controller now has an up or down button.
Output changes to:

2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Button Pressed “Down” on Floor 3
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Lift #1 selected on Floor 2
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #1 moving
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #1 arrived on Floor 3

## Question 3
The company expanded their staff and are now in need of more lifts. 
Implement the changes so that more than 2 lifts can be used (Future proof it to any amount)
Output stays the same.

## Getting started



## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
