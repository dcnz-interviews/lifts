# Lifts
Here at Datacom we work with all kinds of customer problems on a day to day basis. 
<br />
These can range from search algorithms on shopping applications to full-blown scalable systems with multiple databases and integration points. 
<br />
For this challenge we don't want you to spend an entire week coding away at a maybe. Please plan and structure it carefully and you'll find it to be easy.
<br />
Hopefully this sparks some of that passion we share for solving problems and future proofing for the next colleague that comes along. 
<br />
To complete this please fork from this git repository and treat each question as a feature branch, you can merge them back into main once you've completed each of them. 
<br />
Remember to add in some unit tests to randomize the input.

## Getting started
Create yourself a github account if you don't have one already. 
Create a new repository called Lifts.
Fork from this repository and push all your commits to your newly created repo.

## Question 1
There are two lifts in a building with a single controller at the bottom floor (Sorry people at the top floor)
This single controller checks which lift is the closest and notifies it to come down to the ground floor.
The following output needs to be displayed:

2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Button Pressed “Up”
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Lift #2 selected
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #2 moving
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #2 arrived

## Question 2
After multiple complaints from people the company decided to add in a controller on each level.
Implement the new logic, remember the controller now has an up or down button.
Output changes to:

2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Button Pressed “Down” on Floor 3
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 - Lift #1 selected on Floor 2
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #1 moving
<br />
2022-04-11 21:21:00 – Lift #1 arrived on Floor 3

## Question 3
The company expanded their staff and are now in need of more lifts. 
Implement the changes so that more than 2 lifts can be used (Future proof it to any amount)
Output stays the same.
